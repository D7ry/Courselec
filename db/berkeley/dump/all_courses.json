Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and distributes power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem. Figuring out how to do that, and sorting out the consequences, is our project in this class.",

While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate. Topics include sexual differentiation and sex differences in behavior, reproductive, parental, and aggressive behaviors, and hormonal and behavioral homeostatic regulation.",

Therefore, it is clear that the course enrollment should be increased to accommodate students from both inside and outside the CED.\nThis course offers students the opportunity to examine a specific range of sustainable design interventions that attempt to address primary problems related to climate change, the need for healthy watersheds, adequate food security and socially resilient communities in the face of rapid environmental change. Students will see the complexity of various aspects and approaches required of sustainable design and occasionally competing goals of a project.",

They will learn about design that can facilitate positive social systems and how the combination of ecological and social communities can present answers to some of the pressing environmental problems we face. Students will learn how various design strategies involve land preservation, watershed protection and restoration; local food production networks; resilient neighborhood design through community participation in open space design; pedestrian and bicycle friendly streets, urban forestry; reducing the waste stream."

You will learn how to guess intelligently, how to follow your hunches while guided by the laws of physics, and how to maximize understanding from just a modicum of information --- how to reason inductively and quantitatively. All of undergraduate physics --- mechanics, E&M, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics --- will be covered in useful, memorable, and entertaining ways.",

The course is also committed to an exploration of how planners can move towards more emancipatory land-use practices.",

Its study is critical to understand how consumers think and behave, which is critical for a company wishing to develop a customer focus. Given how different people are, it is amazing how similarly their minds work. Consumer psychology is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions. It is one of the building blocks of the study of marketing and provides the student with a set of tools with diverse applications.",

Is the Earth a common type of planet or some cosmic quirk? This course will introduce basic physics, chemistry, and math to understand planets, moons, rings, comets, asteroids, atmospheres, and oceans. Understanding other worlds will help us save our own planet and help us understand our place in the universe.",
